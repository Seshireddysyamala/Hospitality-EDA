# Hospitality-EDA
## Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Hospitality Company dataset** to uncover key insights related to customer behavior, revenue trends, and operational performance. Using **Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn**, we analyze the dataset to extract actionable insights that can help improve hotel decision-making.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of multiple attributes capturing various aspects of hotel operations, including:
- **Booking details** (check-in/check-out dates, number of guests, room type)
- **Revenue & Pricing** (room rates, revenue per room)
- **Customer Demographics** (age, region, stay duration)
- **Operational Metrics** (occupancy rate, cancellation rate)

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Steps
1. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, incorrect data types, and duplicates.
2. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summary statistics and data distribution.
3. **Revenue & Occupancy Analysis:** Identifying seasonal trends and revenue growth.
4. **Customer Behavior Analysis:** Understanding booking patterns, cancellation rates, and customer preferences.
5. **Visualizations:** Using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn** to create meaningful charts.

## Key Findings
- **Revenue Growth:** The hotel has seen a **steady increase in revenue** over time, with peak seasons generating the highest profits.
- **Occupancy Rates:** The highest occupancy occurs in **summer months**, while off-season discounts help maintain steady bookings.
- **Cancellation Trends:** A significant percentage of cancellations occur within **3 days of booking**, possibly indicating flexible cancellation policies.
- **Customer Insights:** Business travelers prefer **short stays**, while vacationers opt for **extended bookings**.
